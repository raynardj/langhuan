# LangHuAn
> **Lang**uage **Hu**man **An**notations, a frontend for tagging AI project labels, drived by pandas dataframe data.

> From Chinese word **ÁêÖÂ¨õ[langhuan]** (Legendary realm where god curates books)

Here's a [5 minutes youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwh6roiX_9I) explaining how langhuan works

[![Introduction Video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raynardj/langhuan/main/docs/imgs/ner1.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwh6roiX_9I)

## Installation
```shell
pip install langhuan
```

## Minimun configuration walk through
> langhuan start a flask application from **pandas dataframe** üêº !

### Simplest configuration for **NER** task üöÄ

```python
from langhuan import NERTask

app = NERTask.from_df(
    df, text_col="description",
    options=["institution", "company", "name"])
app.run("0.0.0.0", port=5000)
```

### Simplest configuration for **Classify** task üöÄ
```python
from langhuan import ClassifyTask

app = ClassifyTask.from_df(
    df, text_col="comment",
    options=["positive", "negative", "unbiased", "not sure"])
app.run("0.0.0.0", port=5000)
```

## Frontend
> You can visit following pages for this app.

### Tagging
```http://[ip]:[port]/``` is for our hard working taggers to visit.

### Admin
```http://[ip]:[port]/admin``` is a page where you can üëÆüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è:
* See the progress of each user.
* Force save the progress, (or it will only save according to ```save_frequency```, default 42 entries)
* Download the tagged entries

## Advanced settings
#### Validation
You can set minimun verification number: ```cross_verify_num```, aka, how each entry will be validated, default is 1

If you set ```cross_verify_num``` to 2, and you have 5 taggers, each entry will be seen by 2 taggers

```python
app = ClassifyTask.from_df(
    df, text_col="comment",
    options=["positive", "negative", "unbiased", "not sure"],
    cross_verify_num=2,)
```

#### Preset the tagging
You can set a column in dataframe, eg. called ```guessed_tags```, to preset the tagging result.

Each cell can contain the format of tagging result, eg. 
```json
{"tags":[
    {"text": "Genomicare Bio Tech", "offset":32, "label":"company"},
    {"text": "East China University of Politic Science & Law", "offset":96, "label":"company"},
    ]}
```

Then you can run the app with preset tag column
```python
app = NERTask.from_df(
    df, text_col="description",
    options=["institution", "company", "name"],
    preset_tag_col="guessed_tags")
app.run("0.0.0.0", port=5000)
```

#### Order strategy
The order of which text got tagged first is according to order_strategy.

Default is set to ```"forward_match"```, you can try ```pincer``` or ```trident```
![order strategies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raynardj/langhuan/main/docs/imgs/strategies.jpg)

Assume the order_by_column is set to the prediction of last batch of deep learning model:
- trident means the taggers tag the most confident positive, most confident negative, most unsure ones first.

#### Load History
If your service stopped, you can recover the progress from cache.

Previous cache will be at ```$HOME/.cache/langhuan/{task_name}```

You can change the save_frequency to suit your task, default is 42 entries.

```python
app = NERTask.from_df(
    df, text_col="description",
    options=["institution", "company", "name"],
    save_frequency=128,
    load_history=True,
    task_name="task_NER_210123_110327"
    )
```

#### Admin Control
> This application assumes internal use within organization, hence the mininum security. If you set admin_control, all the admin related page will require ```adminkey```, the key will appear in the console prompt

```python
app = NERTask.from_df(
    df, text_col="description",
    options=["institution", "company", "name"],
    admin_control=True,
    )
```

#### From downloaded data => pytorch dataset
> For downloaded NER data tags, you can create a dataloader with the json file automatically:
* [pytorch + huggingface tokenizer](https://raynardj.github.io/langhuan/docs/loader)
* tensorflow + huggingface tokenizer, development pending

#### Gunicorn support
This is a **light weight** solution. When move things to gunicorn, multithreads is acceptable, but multiworkers will cause chaos.

```shell
gunicorn --workers=1 --threads=5 app:app
```

## Compatibility üíç
Well, this library hasn't been tested vigorously against many browsers with many versions, so far
* compatible with chrome, firefox, safari if version not too old.
