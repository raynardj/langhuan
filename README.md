## Installation
```shell
pip install langhuan
```

## Minimun configuration walk through
> langhuan start a flask application from pandas dataframe

### Simplest configuration for **NER** task 🚀

```python
from langhuan import NERTask

app = NERTask.from_df(
    df, text_col="description",
    options=["institution", "company", "name"])
app.run("0.0.0.0", port=5000)
```

### Simplest configuration for **Classify** task 🚀
```python
from langhuan import ClassifyTask

app = ClassifyTask.from_df(
    df, text_col="comment",
    options=["positive", "negative", "unbiased", "not sure"])
app.run("0.0.0.0", port=5000)
```

## Frontend
> You can visit following pages for this app.

### Tagging
```http://[ip]:[port]/``` is for our hard working taggers to visit.

### Admin
```http://[ip]:[port]/admin``` is a page where you can 👮🏽‍♂️:
* See the progress of each user.
* Force save the progress, (or it will only save according to ```save_frequency```, default 42 entries)
* Download the tagged entries

## Advanced settings
#### Validation
You can set minimun verification number: ```cross_verify_num```, aka, how each entry will be validated, default is 1

If you set ```cross_verify_num``` to 2, and you have 5 taggers, each entry will be seen by 2 taggers

```python
app = ClassifyTask.from_df(
    df, text_col="comment",
    options=["positive", "negative", "unbiased", "not sure"],
    cross_verify_num=2,)
```

#### Load History
If your service stopped, you can recover the progress from cache.

Previous cache will be at ```$HOME/.cache/langhuan/{task_name}```

You can change the save_frequency to suit your task, default is 42 entries.

```python
app = NERTask.from_df(
    df, text_col="description",
    options=["institution", "company", "name"],
    save_frequency=128,
    load_history=True,
    task_name="task_NER_210123_110327"
    )
```

#### Admin Control
> This application assumes internal use within organization, hence the mininum security. If you set admin_control, all the admin related page will require ```adminkey```, the key will appear in the console prompt

```python
app = NERTask.from_df(
    df, text_col="description",
    options=["institution", "company", "name"],
    admin_control=True,
    )
```

### Compatibility
Well, this library hasn't been tested vigorously against many browsers with many versions, so far
* compatible with chrome, firefox, safari if version not too old.
